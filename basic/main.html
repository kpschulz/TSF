       <h2>About the “Community Thanksgiving Brunch”</h2>
       <b></b>
       This affair is designed to provide a safe, fun and free food to the underprivileged people in the Miami area. The day starts with 
       an orchestra playing spiritual songs, after which a sumptuous buffet is served followed by spiritual exhortation, poetry, 
       liturgical dancers, comedy or, a game of some sort that features this affair.
       <b></b>
       The Community Thanksgiving Brunch is expected to attract over four hundred (400) individuals from the little Haiti, North Miami 
       and North Miami Beach regions. The event is as usual by invitation only.
